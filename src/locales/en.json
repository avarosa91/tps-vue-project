On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.\n\n</p> <p>If you’d like to learn more about Vue before diving in, we created a video walking through the core principles and a sample project.\n\n</p> <p>If you are an experienced frontend developer and want to know how Vue compares to other libraries/frameworks, check out the Comparison with Other Frameworks.</p>"
